                targeted advertising on websites through members of the Network Advertising
                Initiative by clicking here or the Digital Advertising Alliance by clicking here,
                selecting the user’s country, and then clicking “Choices” (or similarly titled

              <p>&ZeroWidthSpace;</p>

              <p>
                Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer when you visit a site.
                Cookies serve different purposes, like helping us understand how a site is being
                used, letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences
                and generally improving your browsing experience.

              <p>Who places cookies on my device?</p>

              <p>&ZeroWidthSpace;</p>

              <p>
                Cookies set by the site you visit are called “first party cookies.” Cookies set by
                parties other than us are called “third party cookies.” Third party cookies enable
                third party features or functionality within the site, such as site analytics,
                advertising and social media features. The parties that set these third party
                cookies can recognize your computer or device both when it visits the site in
                question and also when it visits certain other sites and/or mobile apps. We do not
                control how these third parties use your information, which is subject to their own
                privacy policies. See below for details on use of third party cookies and similar

              <p>&ZeroWidthSpace;</p>

              <p>
                The length of time a cookie will stay on your device depends on whether it is a
                “persistent” or “session” cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device
                until you st &nbsp;op browsing. Persistent cookies stay on your browsing device
                after you have finished browsing until they expire or are deleted.

                These cookies track your browsing habits to enable us and third-party advertising

                information about your browsing history to group you with other users who have

              <p>What other tracking technologies should I know about?</p>

              <p>
                Cookies are not the only way to track visitors to a site or app. Companies use tiny
                graphics files with unique identifiers called beacons (and also “pixels” or “clear
                gifs”) to recognize when someone visits its sites. These technologies often depend
                on cookies to function properly, and so disabling cookies may impair their
                functioning.

                Unlike other cookies, Flash cookies cannot be removed or rejected via your browser

                you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using
                the tools contained in the website storage settings panel at this website

                this website and following the instructions. Please note that setting the Flash
                Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the

              <p>
                We may also use pixel tags (which are also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) on
                our Sites and in our HTML formatted emails to track the actions of users on our
                Sites and interactions with our emails. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard
                drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded
                invisibly on webpages or within HTML formatted emails. Pixel tags are used to
                demonstrate that a webpage was accessed or that certain content was viewed,
                typically to measure the success of our marketing campaigns or engagement with our
                emails and to compile statistics about usage of the Sites, so that we can manage our
                content more effectively.

              <p>
                Our Sites may use software development kits (“SDKs”) provided by third parties. SDKs
                enable us to provide features and functionality developed by third-party developers,
                including to provide us with analytics, social media integration, and advertising.
                The SDKs we use may enable third parties to collect information about the users of
                our Sites. The types of SDKs we use include:

              <p>Analytics SDKs</p>

              <p>&ZeroWidthSpace;</p>

              <p>
                These SDKs are used to collect information about use of our Sites. The information
                gathered may include the types of information described in the Privacy Policy
                section titled “Information automatically collected.” We use this information to
                help operate our Sites more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information,
                monitor the level of activity on and within the application, diagnose errors, and
                improve the mobile application.

              <p>&ZeroWidthSpace;</p>

              <p>
                These SDKs help you to interact with social networks you are signed into while using
                our Sites, such as by sharing content with the social network and other features you
                use with the social network. Social networks may also work with our Sites for
                analytics or advertising purposes, as discussed above.

              <p>&ZeroWidthSpace;</p>

              <p>
                These SDKs allow our advertising partners to collect information about your devices,
                and how you use our Sites over time; and to use this information to show you ads of
                potential interest and measure how the ads perform. These third parties’ collection,
                use, and sharing of your personal information is subject to their own privacy
                policies. You may be able to control or limit use of certain information collected
                through advertising SDKs for purposes of targeted advertising. For additional
                information, please review the “Targeted advertising” portion of the “Your Choices”
                section of the Privacy Policy.
